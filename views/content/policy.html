This allows Smaaash to provide services and features that most likely meet User needs, and to customize this website to make his experience safer and easier.&nbsp;<br />
              	In general, User can browse the website without revealing any personal information about him. Once User gives Smaaash his personal information, User is not anonymous. Wherever possible, Smaaash will indicate the fields required and optional. Users always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the website. User may provide Smaaash a user ID.&nbsp;<br />
              	Smaaash may automatically track certain information about User based on his behaviour while accessing its website. This information is collected for internal research on the users&rsquo; demographics, interests, and behaviour to understand, protect and serve the users of this website better.

The cookies do not contain any of User&rsquo;s personally identifiable information. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember information specific to a given user. Smaaash offers certain features that are only available through the use of &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;. Use of cookies also requires using User password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that interests User. Most cookies are &ldquo;session cookies,&rdquo; meaning that they are automatically deleted from User hard drive at the end of a session. User is always free to decline these cookies if his browser permits, although in that case User may not be able to use certain features on the website and may be required to re-enter hi password more frequently during a session.&nbsp;<br />

              	<li>
              	<p><strong>Minors&nbsp;<br />
              	As Smaaash&rsquo; cannot distinguish the age of persons who access its website, a blanket privacy policy is applied. Smaaash&rsquo; website does not seek or intend to seek and receive any personal information from minors (i.e. below eighteen years of age as per Indian legislations). Should a parent or guardian have reason to believe that a minor has provided www.smaaash.in with personal information without their prior consent, they may contact us to ensure that the personal information is removed and unsubscribed from any promotional contact opportunities.</strong></p>
              	</li>
              	<li>
              	<p><strong>Security&nbsp;<br />
              	Smaaash website has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of User personal information under its control. Smaaash uses secure server/s. Once User information is in its possession Smaaash adheres to strict security guidelines, protecting it against unauthorized access.&nbsp;<br />
              	Additionally Users can be assured that the information they provide to www.smaaash.in is transmitted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. If a User becomes aware of any security breach, please let us know as soon as possible.&nbsp;<br />
              	Smaaash has internal procedures in place requiring its employees and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by www.smaaash.in&nbsp;<br />
              	Unfortunately, despite the aforementioned technology and security features, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be hundred percent secure, so Smaaash cannot give an absolute assurance that the personal information Users provide will be secure at all times, and Smaaash will not be responsible for any event arising from unauthorized access to Users&rsquo; personal information. Likewise, Smaaash will not be held responsible for events arising from third parties gaining unauthorized access to User personal information.&nbsp;<br />
              	Smaaash may use overseas facilities to process or back up User personal information. As a result, Smaaash may transfer to and store User personal information at its overseas facilities. However, this does not change any of its commitments to safeguard Users&rsquo; privacy in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
